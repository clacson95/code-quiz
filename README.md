## Description
This application is a quiz that tests users on basic knowledge regarding web development. Through the use of HTML and JavaScript, this application allows users to answer multiple choice questions and earn a score depending on their performance that can be recorded in the Highscores page via local storage.

This application has been deployed to GitHub Pages:

## Usage
There are two methods to use this application:

1. Use the link above to access the deployed application. 
2. Alternatively, you can fork the repository, clone the repository, or download the ZIP file to access/change the code. This will require you to have a text editor. I recommend Visual Studio Code, but there are a plethora of other options available.

Once running the application, click the "Start Quiz" button to begin the quiz, and answer the questions one by one. Once all questions are answered or the time runs out, you will be asked to enter your initials and click the Submit button. You can then go back to the starting screen and take the quiz again, or clear the current high scores. A "View High Scores" button in the top left will allow you to review the current high scores at any point, although doing so during the quiz will forfeit your current progress.
